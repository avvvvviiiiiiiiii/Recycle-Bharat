Excellent — now you’re thinking like a **product owner**, not just a hackathon participant.
What you’re asking for is essentially a **handoff-grade Project Requirement Document (PRD)** that an **agent / program manager / Antigravity / dev team** can pick up and start execution **without ambiguity**.

Below is a **clean, structured, implementation-ready PRD**.
You can copy this into a doc / Notion / Jira / GitHub README and it will still make sense.

# 📄 PROJECT REQUIREMENT DOCUMENT (PRD)

## Project Name

**Digital Product Passport for Incentive-Driven E-Waste Management**

## Problem Statement

India faces a rapidly growing e-waste crisis due to short device lifecycles, lack of device-level tracking, dominance of informal recycling, low citizen participation, and fragmented government visibility. Existing systems track e-waste at an aggregated or regulatory level but fail to provide **end-to-end lifecycle transparency**, **economic incentives**, and **real-time governance data**.

---

## 1. Product Vision

To build a **digital, incentive-driven platform** that assigns a unique identity to every electronic device and tracks it from **ownership → recycling request → collection → authorized recycling**, while rewarding citizens and collectors and enabling real-time government monitoring.

---

## 2. Objectives

* Enable **device-level lifecycle tracking**
* Incentivize **responsible disposal** by citizens
* Digitally integrate **kabadi/collectors** into formal systems
* Improve **authorized recycling compliance**
* Provide **real-time analytics** to government authorities
* Support **circular economy & SDG-12**

---

## 3. System Overview (High Level)

The system consists of:

* A **central backend platform**
* **Four role-based dashboards**
* A **state-based lifecycle engine**
* A **government analytics layer**

### Device Lifecycle States

```
ACTIVE
→ RECYCLING_REQUESTED
→ COLLECTOR_ASSIGNED
→ COLLECTED
→ DELIVERED_TO_RECYCLER
→ RECYCLED (FINAL)
```

## 4. User Roles & Access Control (RBAC)

| Role                   | Access Level                                 |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Citizen                | Own devices, request recycling, track status |
| Kabadi / Collector     | Accept pickup, collect & deliver devices     |
| Recycler (Authorized)  | Manage requests, assign collectors, recycle  |
| Government / Authority | View analytics, compliance & trends          |
| System Admin           | Manage users, roles, configurations          |

### What we should do next (recommended)

Choose one:

1. Convert this into **Jira epics & user stories**
2. Create **API contract (endpoint list)**
3. Design **database schema**
4. Prepare **execution roadmap (7–30–90 days)**

Tell me which one you want — we’ll keep building like a real team.
