Perfect. Now we turn this into an **execution-grade plan** that a PM, agent, or dev lead can actually run.
I’ll give you a **phase-wise + task-wise TODO list**, and **clear success metrics (exit criteria)** for moving to the next phase.
This is how real products are built and evaluated.

No fluff. No buzzwords. Just control points.

---

# ✅ PHASE-WISE TODO LIST WITH SUCCESS CHECKS

---

## 🔹 PHASE 0 — Product & Scope Lock (FOUNDATION)

### 🎯 Goal

Remove ambiguity. Everyone agrees *what exactly is being built*.

### Tasks

* [ ] Finalize PRD (this document)
* [ ] Lock user roles: Citizen, Kabadi, Recycler, Govt, Admin
* [ ] Lock device lifecycle states
* [ ] Decide MVP vs Future scope
* [ ] Freeze incentive logic (credits for citizen, payout for kabadi)

### Success Metrics (Gate to Phase 1)

* ✔ All stakeholders agree on **one lifecycle flow**
* ✔ No open questions about roles or permissions
* ✔ PRD signed off (even if informally)

👉 If this is not clear, **STOP**. Coding now = wasted effort.

---

## 🔹 PHASE 1 — System Design & Architecture

### 🎯 Goal

Translate idea → technical structure.

### Tasks

* [ ] Draw high-level system architecture
* [ ] Define RBAC (who can do what)
* [ ] Define device lifecycle state machine
* [ ] Design database schema (tables + relations)
* [ ] Define API contracts (inputs/outputs)

### Key Artifacts

* Architecture diagram
* DB schema
* API list

### Success Metrics (Gate to Phase 2)

* ✔ Every feature maps to a table + API
* ✔ No feature without an owner (role)
* ✔ State transitions are deterministic (no confusion)

👉 If devs still ask “what happens after X?”, redesign.

---

## 🔹 PHASE 2 — Backend Core (SYSTEM BRAIN)

### 🎯 Goal

Make the system **functionally correct**, UI can come later.

### Tasks

* [ ] Setup backend project (Node + Express)
* [ ] Implement authentication (JWT)
* [ ] Implement RBAC middleware
* [ ] Implement device lifecycle engine
* [ ] APIs for:

  * Device registration
  * Recycling request
  * Collector assignment
  * Status updates
* [ ] Audit logs for every state change

### Success Metrics (Gate to Phase 3)

* ✔ Device can move end-to-end through all states
* ✔ Unauthorized role actions are blocked
* ✔ Every action is logged
* ✔ APIs work via Postman without UI

👉 If lifecycle breaks → do NOT proceed.

---

## 🔹 PHASE 3 — Database & Data Integrity

### 🎯 Goal

Ensure **data consistency and traceability**.

### Tasks

* [ ] Implement PostgreSQL schema
* [ ] Enforce foreign keys & constraints
* [ ] Seed test data (citizens, devices, collectors)
* [ ] Handle rollback / failure cases
* [ ] Ensure no orphan records

### Success Metrics (Gate to Phase 4)

* ✔ No duplicate device ownership
* ✔ No illegal state transitions
* ✔ Every recycled device has a full history
* ✔ Data survives restart/crash

👉 This is what judges call *robust*.

---

## 🔹 PHASE 4 — Citizen Dashboard (USER ENTRY POINT)

### 🎯 Goal

Enable citizens to *actually use* the system.

### Tasks

* [ ] Citizen login & profile
* [ ] View owned devices
* [ ] Request recycling
* [ ] Track lifecycle timeline
* [ ] Credit points display

### Success Metrics

* ✔ Citizen can recycle without admin help
* ✔ Status updates reflect backend changes
* ✔ UX understandable in <30 seconds

👉 If a non-tech user is confused → redesign.

---

## 🔹 PHASE 5 — Kabadi / Collector Dashboard

### 🎯 Goal

Digitally integrate informal workers **without friction**.

### Tasks

* [ ] Simple login flow
* [ ] View assigned pickups
* [ ] Enter device ID & confirm collection
* [ ] Mark delivery to recycler
* [ ] Earnings view

### Success Metrics

* ✔ Kabadi completes task in ≤3 clicks
* ✔ No typing-heavy flows
* ✔ Collection updates reflect instantly

👉 If it feels complex → it will fail in real life.

---

## 🔹 PHASE 6 — Recycler Dashboard

### 🎯 Goal

Formalize recycling & compliance.

### Tasks

* [ ] View incoming requests
* [ ] Accept/reject requests
* [ ] Assign kabadi
* [ ] Mark device as recycled
* [ ] Recovery summary entry

### Success Metrics

* ✔ Recycler controls workflow
* ✔ No device bypasses recycler
* ✔ Compliance data is complete

---

## 🔹 PHASE 7 — Government / Authority Dashboard

### 🎯 Goal

Deliver **policy value**, not just charts.

### Tasks

* [ ] Global metrics (registered, recycled)
* [ ] Region-wise analytics
* [ ] Recycler performance stats
* [ ] Historical trends
* [ ] Exportable reports

### Success Metrics

* ✔ Dashboard answers “what’s happening?”
* ✔ Data is real-time or near real-time
* ✔ Trends visible, not just numbers

👉 This slide often wins hackathons.

---

## 🔹 PHASE 8 — Incentives & Trust Layer

### 🎯 Goal

Ensure adoption via incentives.

### Tasks

* [ ] Credit calculation logic
* [ ] Kabadi payout simulation
* [ ] Citizen recognition badges
* [ ] Fraud prevention checks

### Success Metrics

* ✔ Incentives only on completed recycling
* ✔ No double-claiming possible
* ✔ Clear audit trail

---

## 🔹 PHASE 9 — Testing & Demo Readiness

### 🎯 Goal

Be demo-proof under pressure.

### Tasks

* [ ] Full end-to-end test (citizen → recycler)
* [ ] Role misuse testing
* [ ] Edge case testing
* [ ] Demo script preparation
* [ ] Fallback data for demo

### Success Metrics (FINAL GATE)

* ✔ Demo runs without manual DB edits
* ✔ One device can be shown live
* ✔ Team members know their parts
* ✔ System survives random clicks

---

# 📊 MASTER SUCCESS METRICS (GLOBAL)

You are **ready** if:

* ≥1 device completes full lifecycle
* All 4 dashboards work
* No manual backend intervention needed
* Story can be explained in 2 minutes
* Judges can’t break the flow with “what if” questions

---

## 🧠 Mentor Reality Check

Most teams stop at Phase 4–5.
If you reach **Phase 7**, you’re in **top-tier execution**.

You now have:

* A real roadmap
* Clear gates
* Engineering discipline

---

### What I recommend next (very high value)

Pick ONE:

1. Convert this into **Jira epics + tickets**
2. Define **API endpoints in detail**
3. Design **DB schema (tables + fields)**
4. Create **judge demo flow (minute-by-minute)**

Tell me which one you want — we’ll keep moving like a real startup team.
